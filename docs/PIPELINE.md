# Pipeline: Blender to Unity

How the tools connect and how an asset gets from Blender into the game.

## Tools

| Tool | Version | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unity Editor | 6000.6.3f1 (Unity 6), HDRP 17.6, DirectX 12 | `C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.6.3f1` (Windows build target) |
| Unity Hub | | `S:\Unity\Unity Hub` |
| Blender | 5.2.2 LTS | Blender MCP add-on v1.7 |
| uv / uvx | | `S:\Tools\uv` (runs both MCP servers) |
| Git + Git LFS | LFS 3.7.1 | GitHub CLI at `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI`, account `zetazuni` |

## MCP connections (how Claude drives the tools)

Both are registered in Claude Code at **user scope**, so they work from any folder.

- **Blender** (`blender`): `S:\Tools\uv\uvx.exe blender-mcp`. Add-on source is at `S:\Tools\blender-mcp`. To connect: open Blender, press N in the 3D viewport, open the BlenderMCP tab and start the server. Claude checks with `get_addon_status`.
- **Unity** (`unity`): `S:\Tools\uv\uvx.exe --from mcpforunityserver mcp-for-unity --transport stdio` (Coplay's MCP for Unity). The bridge package `com.coplaydev.unity-mcp` is already in `Packages/manifest.json`. To connect: open this project in Unity, then go to Window > MCP for Unity and click Start Session. Claude Code has to be restarted once after the server is first registered so the tools load.
- **Unity transport must be Stdio.** In the MCP for Unity window, set Transport to `Stdio`, then Start Session. Do not use the setup wizard's "Configure" button for Claude Code: it switches Unity to HTTP mode and adds a `UnityMCP` HTTP entry (http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp) that needs a separate server nobody starts, so it fails with "[WebSocket] Connection failed". If that entry shows up again, remove it with `claude mcp remove UnityMCP -s local` from this folder.
- If a tool says it cannot connect, the fix is almost always to open the app and start its session, not to reinstall. Unity's own log is `Logs/Editor.log` in this folder.

## Units and axes

- 1 Blender unit = 1 metre = 1 Unity unit. **1 floor tile = 1 m.** Ground floor wall height is 3 m.
- Blender is Z up, Unity is Y up. Export settings (checked and working): Forward `-Z`, Up `Y`, Apply Unit Scale, Apply Scalings "FBX All", **Apply Transform (bake space transform) on**, apply modifiers, smoothing "Face", selected object only, no leaf bones, no animation.
- **Origin:** the centre of the footprint, on the floor (z = 0 in Blender). Move the object to the world origin before exporting.
- **Facing:** the front of a piece faces **-Y in Blender**, which arrives in Unity facing **+Z** (toward the garden) at rotation 0. Verified with the sofa in session 3.
- Room floor plates are 2 cm thick, so furniture is placed at floor height + 0.02 m (`FLOOR_TOP` in the builder).

## Folders

```
Blender/                 source .blend files (Git LFS), one per set: house.blend, furniture_living.blend ...
Assets/Art/Models/       exported .fbx, one file per piece, named by item id
Assets/Art/Materials/    shared palette materials
Assets/Art/Textures/     palette atlas and any real textures
Assets/Scenes/           Main.unity and test scenes
Assets/Scripts/          C# (Camera, Build, Economy, People, Pets, Time, UI, Cloud)
docs/                    these notes
```

## Naming

- Item ids match the 2D game where the piece exists there (`sofa`, `platformbed`, `marbletable`, `mazda3` ...). The id is the Blender object name, the FBX file name and the id in the item catalogue.
- New pieces use short lowercase ids with no spaces.

## Modelling standard (rule 6: PC, high poly)

- Real proportions and real sizes. Soft edges everywhere: bevel modifiers with 3 to 10 segments, subdivision (level 2) on anything upholstered, a Cast (sphere) modifier to puff cushions, 32 to 48 sided cylinders, rounded corners on slabs. Small details are welcome (feet, tassels, shelves, seams).
- **One child mesh per part under an empty named after the item id** (for example `sofa` > `base`, `arm`, `seat 1`...). Unity gives every part its own convex collider, so the physics shape follows the real shape.
- **UVs in metres:** box mapping in object space where 1 UV unit = 1 m (`box_uv` in the Blender toolkit). Unity tiles each texture at its real size, so every piece matches the others.
- Apply modifiers and transforms before export. Export the root empty and its children (object types Empty and Mesh).
- The Blender toolkit (helpers `part`, `rounded_slab`, `cylinder`, `root`, `box_uv`) is recreated at the start of each modelling session; see the session 4 devlog for the recipe.

## Materials and colour options

- Blender material slots use **shared names** (`Fabric_main`, `Walnut`, `Marble_main`, `BlackSteel`, `Rug_main`, `RugBorder`, `Cushion_main` so far). Blender colours are only for previewing.
- On import, **Tiramisu > Import furniture** (`Assets/Editor/FurnitureImport.cs`) swaps each slot for the Unity material of the same name in `Assets/Art/Materials/Furniture/`. `FurnitureImport.Looks` says which texture set, tint, smoothness range and metallic each name gets (for example `Fabric_main` = wool boucle, `Walnut` = American walnut veneer, `Marble_main` = marble). Tune the look there.
- A slot name ending in **`_main`** is the part the colour options will tint.
- New material name? Add it to `Looks` (and its texture set to `tools/fetch_textures.py` if needed) or it arrives neutral grey on purpose.

## Physics for a new piece

- Add its id to `PhysicsSetup.Specs` with a real mass in kg, whether it can move, and a drop height if it should fall into place (like cushions).
- Colliders and physics materials are added automatically from the parts and the material names.

## Workflow for one asset

1. Model it in Blender (via MCP or by hand) at real size, origin and facing as above, check it with a viewport screenshot.
2. Save the `.blend` in `Blender/` (one file per set, `furniture_living.blend` holds sofa, marbletable, geomrug, cushion), export `<id>.fbx` into `Assets/Art/Models/`.
3. In Unity run **Tiramisu > Build greybox house**. It imports the models, links the materials and places everything listed in the builder's `Layout` table (`id, x, z, rotation, floor`).
4. Check it in play mode from a few angles, then commit the `.blend`, the FBX and the code together.

## Textures, sky and other downloaded assets

- PBR texture sets: `python tools/fetch_textures.py` downloads the sets listed in its `SETS` into `Assets/Art/Textures/<id>/` at 2K, packs the HDRP mask map, writes real sizes to `textures.json` and credits to `CREDITS.txt`. About 275 MB for 20 sets, stored with Git LFS (watch the GitHub LFS quota before adding lots more; 4K sets are 4x bigger).
- The sky is HDRP's physically based sky with a cloud layer (no image needed). The old HDRI (`Assets/Art/Sky`, CC0) is kept in case an HDRI sky option is wanted later.
- Only use CC0 or properly licensed assets, since the repo is public, and always keep a credit file next to them.
