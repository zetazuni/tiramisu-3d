# Devlog: Tiramisu 3D

## Session 1: setup (2026-09-26) · v0.0.1

- Connected Claude Code to Unity and Blender through MCP. Unity uses Coplay's MCP for Unity (server `unity`, bridge package in `Packages/manifest.json`). Blender uses the Blender MCP add-on v1.7 on Blender 5.2.2 LTS, confirmed live.
- Created this Unity 6 project (6000.6.3f1) in `S:\Tiramisu Corner by Zetazuni`. For now it is an empty project on the built-in render pipeline.
- Read through the 2D Tiramisu App notes to plan the remake. Wrote `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/RULES.md`, `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md`, `docs/PIPELINE.md` and this devlog.
- Set up git with LFS for Blender files, models, textures and audio, and pushed to the new public repo `zetazuni/tiramisu-3d`.

**Next**
- Open the project in Unity and start the MCP session, then restart Claude Code so the Unity tools load.
- Add URP, the Input System and Cinemachine (through the Unity MCP so the pipeline asset gets set up properly).
- Phase 1: greybox the house at 1 m per tile and build the 360 degree orbit camera with automatic wall fading.
- Confirm the target platform with Amir (assumed WebGL on Netlify).
